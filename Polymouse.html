              Mylène Haprèle is a student in Miss Bustier's class at Collège
              Françoise Dupont. In "Horrificator" after feeling humiliated
              for getting scared easily while filming Nino Lahiffe's movie, she
              gets akumatized by Hawk Moth and becomes Horrificator, a monster
              supervillain. In "Gang of Secrets", after Marinette keeps hiding
              secrets from them, Mylène is re-akumatized by Shadow Moth into
              Horrifcator along with Reflekta, Princess Fragrance, Timebreaker
              and Lady Wifi, the five supervillains all form the Gang of
              Secrets, a group of supervillains who want to reveal Marinette's
              secrets. In "Mega Leech", in order to defeat Malediktator and his
              titular sentimonster, Mylène receives the Mouse Miraculous from
              Ladybug. When the Miraculous is inhabited by Mullo, Mylène becomes
              Polymouse, a mouse-themed superhero who helps Ladybug and Cat Noir
              during "particularly difficult missions" in the fourth season and
              beyond.
