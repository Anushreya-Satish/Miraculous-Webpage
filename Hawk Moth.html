              Gabriel Agreste is Adrienâ€™s father. A wealthy and famous designer,
              he lives alone with his son. Inconsolable since his wife
              disappeared, he almost never leaves his house. What no one know is
              that Gabriel is secretly trying to bring his wife back to life. To
              that end, he must seize the Miraculous of the ladybug and the
              black cat, which grant the powers of creation and destruction. By
              combining them, he could make a wish to recreate a world in which
              his wife would still be here. Gabriel is the holder of the
              Miraculous of the butterfly, which grants the power of
              transmission. With the help of his kwami Nooroo, he transforms
              into Hawk Moth.
